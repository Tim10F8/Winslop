This started as a joke.
Then Microsoft said “slop vs sophistication” out loud and it stopped being one.

To be clear:  
**Windows is not bad.**  
Don’t get me wrong.

**The slop is.**
Winslop does exactly what the name suggests:
- removes slop  
- reduces slop  
- makes slop visible  
- gives control back to the user  

Winslop is what happens when you take that idea seriously.
Not anti-Windows, not anti-AI, just anti-slop.

It removes the unnecessary stuff, tones down the rest and shows you exactly what’s going on.
No cloud, no assistants, no magic.
Everything is local, deterministic and reversible.

Under the hood this is a very small, very focused fork of my earlier project CrapFixer.
Localization never really happened there.
Winslop will likely get it soon, mostly because the codebase is drastically smaller.
Nothing fancy. Just tools.
